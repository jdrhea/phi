# Phi
A game of Phi in vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS

### Rules of phi:
Phi is played on a 4Ã—4 grid, with numbered tiles that slide smoothly when a player moves them using the four arrow keys. Each time you slide, a new tile will randomly appear in an empty spot on the board. Tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until they are stopped by either another tile or the edge of the grid. If two tiles that are consecutive numbers in the Fibbonacci Sequence collide while moving, they will merge into a tile with the total value of the two tiles that collided.
